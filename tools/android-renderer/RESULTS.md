# Renderer verification results

Verified with emulator.wtf on 2026-09-10:

| Device | API | Result |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Pixel 2 | 21 | Passed after API qualification correction |
| Pixel 2 | 24 | 4/4 tests passed |
| Pixel 7 | 34 | 4/4 tests passed |

The initial API 21 run was intentionally diagnostic and found two framework
boundaries: a nested group clip remained active for a following sibling, and a
second sequential clip did not intersect the prior mask-region clip. The single
transformed native clip rendered correctly. API 24 and API 34 passed all pixel
assertions. The converter now conservatively reports API 24 for any drawable
containing multiple clips, while retaining API 21 for one clip.

The final matrix checks 16 independently selected interior/exterior pixels on
API 24 and 34. API 21 checks four transformed-clip pixels and verifies that the
three API-24 resources are not selectable. Opaque expected colors and alpha use
a per-channel tolerance of 2; transparent pixels require alpha <= 2. All sample
coordinates are at least 10 rendered pixels from a geometry edge, so the
tolerance only accommodates renderer variance rather than accepting edge
antialiasing ambiguity.
